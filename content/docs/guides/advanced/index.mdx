**Your First Flow:**
1. Simple 3-node workflow
2. Input → Process → Output
3. Test execution
4. Add error handling
5. Save as template

**Example: Batch Image Generation**

### Advanced Flow Patterns
**Learn**: Complex automation
**Time**: 120 minutes
**Skill Level**: Advanced
**Goal**: Production-ready workflows

**Pattern 1: Conditional Processing**

                                → If Satisfied → Output
```

**Pattern 4: Multi-Output Pipeline**
```
Input → Generate → [Export Format 1, Export Format 2, Export Format 3]
                → Save to different locations
```
