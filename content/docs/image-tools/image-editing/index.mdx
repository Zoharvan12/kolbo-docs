# Image Editing

Transform and modify existing images using AI-powered image-to-image workflows.

## Overview

Image Editing is specifically designed for editing uploaded images. Unlike Text to Image (which creates new images), this tool transforms existing images based on your instructions.

## Key Features

### Image-to-Image Transformations
Upload images and transform them:
- Style transfer
- Content modifications
- Artistic effects
- Structural changes

### AI-Powered Editing
- Intelligent understanding of image content
- Natural-looking modifications
- Preserve important details
- Smart composition adjustments

### Editing Modes
- Replace elements
- Change styles
- Modify backgrounds
- Adjust composition
- Apply artistic effects

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Start with an existing image
2. **Describe Changes**: Tell the AI what to modify
3. **AI Processing**: AI understands and transforms the image
4. **Refine**: Iterate until perfect
