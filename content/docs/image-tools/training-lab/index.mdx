## Key Features

### Model Training on Flux
- Train on Flux AI model
- Upload training images (5-20 recommended)
- Automatic optimization
- Fast training time (~15-30 minutes)

### Consistent Generation
- Generate new images with your trained model
- Perfect consistency across all outputs
- Maintain character/style/brand identity
- Unlimited generations

### Advanced Capabilities

**Combine Multiple Trained Models:**
- Mix different characters in one image
- Combine brand styles

**Reference Images:**
- Use additional reference images with trained models
- Guide pose, composition, or style
- Combine training with real-time references

**Inpainting:**
- Edit specific areas of generated images
- Replace or modify elements
- Maintain trained style in edits

**Image Prompts:**
- Use images as prompts with trained models
- Style transfer with your trained style
- Combine multiple input types
