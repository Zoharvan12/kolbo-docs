# Text to Image

Generate images from text descriptions using various AI models.

## How It Works

1. Write a text prompt describing your image
2. Select AI model(s) from the model selector
3. Choose settings (aspect ratio, quantity, etc.)
4. Click Generate

## Settings

- **Aspect Ratio**: Choose image dimensions (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, etc.)
- **Quantity**: Number of images to generate (1-4)
- **Model Selection**: Choose one or multiple AI models
- **Stylization**: Control creative interpretation (model-specific)
- **Reference Images**: Upload images to guide generation

## Features

### Multi-Model Generation
- Generate with multiple models simultaneously
- Compare results from different AI models
- Each model has unique strengths and styles

### Moodboards
- Create collections of reference images
- Apply moodboard style to generations
- Manage and reuse moodboards across projects

### Image Presets

- Save time with pre-configured settings
- Apply consistent styles across generations

## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts get better results
2. **Try Different Models**: Each model interprets prompts differently
3. **Use References**: Upload images to guide the AI
4. **Experiment**: Test different settings and prompts
