# Custom Agents

Custom Agents are specialized AI assistants you can create with specific instructions, knowledge, and capabilities - similar to Custom GPTs.

## What Are Custom Agents?

Custom Agents are AI assistants configured for specific tasks:
- **Specialized instructions**: Define how the agent behaves
- **Custom knowledge**: Attach files for reference
- **Consistent behavior**: Same instructions every time
- **Shareable**: Share agents with team or community

   - Write what you want the agent to do
   - Be specific about its purpose
   - Describe capabilities and focus areas

3. **AI Enhancement (Optional)**
   - Let AI enhance your description
   - AI generates optimized instructions
   - Or manually continue without enhancement

4. **Configure Agent**
   - **Name**: Give your agent a clear name

The agent can reference these files when responding.
