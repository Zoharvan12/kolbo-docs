# User Memories

User Memories is Kolbo.AI's AI memory system that helps AI understand you better by remembering your preferences, context, and information across all conversations.

## What Are User Memories?

User Memories are pieces of information about you that AI remembers:
- Personal preferences
- Work style and context
- Project information
- Professional background
- Communication preferences
- Important details you want AI to remember

These memories are loaded at the start of every conversation in Chat Tools and Help Widget, allowing AI to provide more personalized and contextually relevant responses.

## How Memories Work

### Automatic Loading
Memories are automatically loaded when you:
- Start a new chat conversation
- Use the Help Widget
- Begin any AI interaction

Along with your memories, the AI also loads:
- Current project description
- Project context
- Relevant information

### Memory Limit
- **Maximum: 100 memories per user**
- Why the limit? More than 100 memories can confuse the AI's context window
- Choose the most important information
- Quality over quantity

## Creating Memories

3. AI processes and creates memory chunks
4. Review and save generated memories
