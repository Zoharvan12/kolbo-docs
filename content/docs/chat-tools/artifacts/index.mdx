# Artifacts

The Artifacts feature provides a dedicated panel for viewing, editing, and previewing code and documents generated by AI in chat conversations.

## What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts are AI-generated outputs that appear in a special preview panel:
- **Code**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other code
- **Websites**: Live website previews
- **Documents**: Formatted documents and content
- **Interactive Content**: Dynamic, interactive elements

Instead of just showing code in the chat, Artifacts provide a better way to view and interact with generated content.

## How Artifacts Work

### Automatic Display
When AI generates compatible content:
1. AI creates code or document
2. Artifacts panel opens automatically
3. Content appears in the panel
4. You can view, edit, and interact

### Artifacts Panel
The panel provides:
- **Code Editor**: Syntax-highlighted code editing
- **Live Preview**: See the result in real-time
- **Split View**: Code and preview side-by-side
- **Full Screen**: Expand for better viewing

## Features

3. **Use Both Views**: Code for details, preview for overall look
4. **Save Work**: Download or copy code regularly
5. **Share Early**: Get feedback with shareable links
6. **Combine Skills**: Use AI for generation, manual for tweaks
7. **Test**: Check functionality in preview
8. **Learn**: Study generated code to improve requests
