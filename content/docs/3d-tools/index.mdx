# 3D Tools

Generate 3D models and assets using Kolbo.AI's 3D generation tools with three different input modes.

## Overview

Kolbo.AI's 3D Tools provide three modes for creating 3D models:
- **Single Image to 3D**: Generate 3D from one image (max 1 image)
- **Multi-Image to 3D**: Create 3D from multiple angles (max 4 images)
- **Text to 3D**: Generate 3D models from text descriptions

## Generation Modes

### Single Image to 3D

Generate a 3D model from a single image:
- Upload 1 image
- AI infers 3D structure from the single view
- Generates complete 3D model
- Fast workflow

**Best for:**
- Product shots with clear views
- Objects with simple geometry
- Quick 3D mockups
- Single-angle references

### Multi-Image to 3D

Create more accurate 3D from multiple angles:
- Upload up to 4 images
- Different angles and perspectives of the same object
- AI reconstructs 3D from multiple views
- More accurate and detailed results

**Best for:**
- Detailed products
- Complex objects
- Photorealistic models
- Professional 3D assets

**Tips:**
- Capture object from different angles
- Consistent lighting across images
- Include front, side, and back views
- 4 images recommended for best results

### Text to 3D

Generate 3D models from text descriptions:
- Describe the object in text
- AI generates 3D model from description
- No images required
- Creative freedom

**Best for:**
- Concept visualization
- Imagined objects
- Quick ideation
- Creative projects without reference images

## Supported File Formats

**Image Upload:**
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- WebP
- HEIC/HEIF

**Maximum file size:** 20MB per image

## Advanced Settings

### T-Pose / A-Pose
Generate the model in A-pose or T-pose:
- Ideal for character models
- Designed for rigging and animation
- Makes character animation easier
- Toggle on/off

### Target Polycount
Control model detail level:
- Adjustable polygon count
- Default: 30,000 polygons
- Higher = more detail, larger file
- Lower = faster, smaller file

### PBR (Physically Based Rendering)
Generate realistic material maps:
- Metallic maps
- Roughness maps
- Normal maps
- Realistic material properties
- **Must be OFF for sculpture art style**

### Prompt Expansion
AI enhancement of your text prompt:
- AI expands your description
- Adds detail for better results
- Improves generation quality
- Toggle on/off

### Topology
Mesh topology type:
- **Triangle**: Standard topology
- **Quad**: Quad-based topology (better for animation/subdivision)

### Symmetry
Model symmetry options:
- **Off**: No symmetry enforced
- **Auto**: AI decides if symmetry is needed
- **On**: Force symmetrical model

### Art Style
Visual style of the model:
- **Realistic**: Photorealistic materials and textures
- **Sculpture**: Artistic sculpture style (PBR must be OFF)

### Texture Prompt
Optional prompt for textures:
- Describe desired textures
- Separate from main prompt
- Refine material appearance
- Optional field

- Mention materials and textures
- Include style references
- Add detail keywords

**Example prompts:**
- "A red ceramic coffee mug with a smooth glossy finish and a curved handle"
- "Modern minimalist wooden chair with straight legs and a cushioned seat"
- "Fantasy sword with ornate gold handle and engraved steel blade"

### Settings Selection
**Choose appropriate settings:**
- T-pose for characters that will be animated
- Higher polycount for detailed models
- PBR on for realistic materials
- PBR off for sculpture art style
- Quad topology for animation workflows

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with single image mode to learn
2. **Quality Input**: Use high-quality, clear images
3. **Multiple Angles**: Use multi-image for better results
4. **Clear Descriptions**: Detailed prompts for text-to-3D
5. **Test Settings**: Experiment with different configurations
6. **Check Preview**: Review in 3D viewer before downloading
7. **Iterate**: Generate variations if needed
8. **Optimize**: Adjust polycount for your use case

## Limitations

### Image Quality
- Better input images = better results
- Low-quality images may produce poor models
- Lighting affects reconstruction quality

### Complex Objects
- Very complex objects may be simplified
- Transparent/reflective materials challenging
- Best results with solid, well-defined objects

### Processing Time
- Single image: Fastest
- Multi-image: Longer (more images = more time)
- Text-to-3D: Varies by complexity
- High polycount: Takes longer

### File Sizes
- Higher polycount = larger files
- PBR maps add to file size
- Consider target platform requirements

## Troubleshooting

**Generation Failed:**
- Check image quality and format
- Verify file size under 20MB
- Try different AI model
- Simplify prompt (text-to-3D)
- Contact support if issue persists

**Poor Results:**
- Use higher quality images
- Try multi-image mode for better accuracy
- Adjust settings (polycount, PBR)
- Write more detailed prompts
- Generate multiple variations

**Model Issues:**
- Check in 3D viewer first
- Verify all angles look correct
- Try different topology setting
- Adjust polycount if needed
- Use PBR appropriately
