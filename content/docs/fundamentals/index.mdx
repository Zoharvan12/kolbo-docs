# Platform Fundamentals

Learn how Kolbo.AI organizes your creative work through a powerful project-based system.

## Overview

Kolbo.AI uses a hierarchical organization system that helps you manage all your AI creative projects efficiently:

- **Projects**: Top-level containers for all your work
- **Sessions**: Individual workspaces within each tool
- **Folders**: Sub-organization within projects
- **Workspace**: Your personal dashboard and overview

## Key Concepts

### Projects

Projects are the main organizational unit in Kolbo.AI. Each project can contain:
- Images, videos, and audio files
- Chat conversations
- Custom trained models
- Workflow automations
- Sessions from all tools

### Sessions

Sessions are individual workspaces within each tool. For example:
- A text-to-image session for product photography
- A chat session for content planning
- A video editing session for marketing materials

### Folders

Organize your projects into folders for better management:
- Create nested folder structures
- Move projects between folders
- Share entire folders with team members

### Workspace

Your personal dashboard where you can:
- View all your projects
- Access recent sessions
- Monitor usage statistics
- Manage team collaboration
