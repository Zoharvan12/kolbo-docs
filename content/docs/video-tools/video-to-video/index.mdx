# Video to Video

Transform existing videos using AI-powered video-to-video workflows including style transfer, character replacement, and motion transfer.

## Overview

Video to Video takes existing video content and transforms it according to your instructions. This includes style changes, character swaps, motion transfer, and more.

## Key Features

### Style Transfer
Apply new styles to videos:
- Artistic styles (oil painting, watercolor, etc.)
- Cinematic looks
- Animation styles
- Custom aesthetics

### Character Replacement
Swap characters in videos:
- Replace any character with another
- Maintain original motion and action
- Seamless integration
- Consistent appearance

### Motion Transfer
Animate characters with video motion:
- Upload reference motion video
- Apply to character image
- Transfer dance moves, actions, gestures
- Create character animations from video

### Video Transformation
Modify video content:
- Change environments
- Alter subjects
- Modify colors and lighting
- Transform scenes

## Unique Features

### Character Replace Tool
Advanced character swapping:
1. Upload source video
2. Identify character to replace
3. Upload or generate replacement character
4. AI seamlessly swaps character while maintaining motion

**Use cases:**
- Replace actor with different character
- Create character variations
- Virtual try-on for characters
- Rapid character testing

### Motion Transfer Mode
Animate characters using video motion:
1. Upload character image (or use trained model)
2. Upload reference motion video (dance, action, etc.)
3. AI applies motion to your character
4. Get animated character video

**Use cases:**
- Animate character art
- Apply dance moves to characters
- Transfer actions and gestures
- Consistent character animation

## Workflow

### Basic Video-to-Video
1. Upload source video
2. Describe desired transformation
3. Choose AI model
4. Generate transformed video
5. Refine with iterations

### Character Replace Workflow
1. Upload video with character to replace
2. Define replacement character (image or description)
3. AI identifies and swaps character
4. Review and refine
5. Export final video

### Motion Transfer Workflow
1. Prepare character image/model
2. Upload reference motion video
3. Set motion transfer parameters
4. Generate animated character
5. Enhance with editing tools

## Available Models

- **Kling**: High-quality transformations
- **Hailuo**: Realistic results
- **Seedance**: Dynamic style changes
- **Custom models**: Use your trained models

## Settings & Controls

### Transformation Settings
- Strength: How much to change
- Preserve structure: Maintain composition
- Style intensity: How strong the style
- Motion adherence: Follow motion closely

### Quality Settings
- Resolution options
- Frame rate
- Duration
- Aspect ratio adjustments

## Best Practices

**Source Video Selection:**
- Clear, well-lit videos work best
- Stable footage for character replace
- Clear motion for motion transfer
- High-resolution sources

**Transformation Tips:**
- Start with lower strength, increase gradually
- Use reference images for style guidance
- Iterate for best results
- Combine with other Kolbo tools

**Motion Transfer Tips:**
- Use clear motion reference videos
- Ensure character image is high quality
- Match camera angles when possible
- Use trained models for consistency

## Use Cases

### Marketing & Content
- Brand style consistency
- Product video variations
- Campaign content adaptations
- Rapid content creation

### Character Animation
- Animate character designs
- Transfer motion to mascots
- Create character variations
- Consistent character videos

### Creative Projects
- Artistic video transformations
- Style experiments
- Music video effects
- Experimental film

### Training & Simulation
- Scenario variations
- Character testing
- Motion studies
- Visualization

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining with Training Lab
Use trained character models:
- Consistent character appearance
- Apply motion to trained characters
- Generate character variations
- Professional character animation

### Multi-Step Workflows
Chain transformations:
1. Character replace in video
2. Apply style transfer
3. Enhance with editing tools
4. Upscale to 4K

### Batch Processing
Process multiple videos:
- Apply same style to multiple videos
- Character replace in series
- Consistent transformations
- Efficient workflows

## Tips for Best Results

1. **High-Quality Source**: Start with good video quality
2. **Clear Instructions**: Be specific about transformations
3. **Iterate**: Generate multiple variations
4. **Use Presets**: Apply proven transformation styles
5. **Post-Process**: Enhance with editing tools
6. **Experiment**: Try different models and settings
7. **Combine Tools**: Use with other Kolbo features
